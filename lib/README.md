Game of life was created by John Conway to simulate cell automation. 
We have created this project using the programming language C to 
learn pointers, memory management and other nuances that come with the language.

To run GameOfLife pass the file 10x10.txt as a parameter. You will have options to 
save the file, quit and load a game.
